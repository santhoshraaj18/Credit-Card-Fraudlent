# Credit Card Kaggle Anomaly Detection

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a Kaggle competition focused on anomaly detection in credit card transactions. The goal of this project is to develop robust algorithms that can identify and flag potentially fraudulent transactions, helping financial institutions protect their customers and minimize losses.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and consists of a large collection of credit card transactions. Each transaction is labeled as either normal or fraudulent, making it suitable for supervised anomaly detection models. The dataset is available in the `data` directory.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-anomaly-detection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd credit-card-anomaly-detection
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

- `data`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
- `src`: Source code for the anomaly detection models and utilities.

## Usage

1. Run the notebooks in the `notebooks` directory sequentially to understand the data and develop the anomaly detection models.

2. Modify the source code in the `src` directory to experiment with different algorithms, hyperparameters, and preprocessing techniques.

3. Evaluate the models using the evaluation metrics provided and fine-tune as needed.
